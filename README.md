<h4 align="center">DEDSEC_BKIF is a keystroke injection tool for Android, Linux, and iOS. With the help of CVE-2023-45866, it grants users unprecedented control over targeted systems, enabling various functions from keystroke injection to advanced system manipulations.</h4>

## DESCRIPTION
DEDSEC_BKIF is a potent Bluetooth exploit tool, leveraging CVE-2023-45866 to exploit a flaw in the Bluetooth protocol. This flaw enables attackers to connect to devices and execute malicious actions such as keystroke injection, unauthorized app installation, command execution, and message forwarding. Its zero-click operation poses a serious threat to device security, highlighting the importance of robust defenses against Bluetooth-based attacks. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication, tricking target devices into pairing without requiring the usual authentication steps, thereby granting unauthorized access. Additionally, DEDSEC_BKIF supports payloads in the rubber ducky format, enhancing its versatility and effectiveness in performing various attacks.
